The Ministry of Education and Children will use the mapping and further direct it to the Directorate of Education to use it to develop and revise education materials. It is expected that various educational projects will be presented in the near future (see measure 707 on climate education for the public), and that a part of them will be useful for the entire educational system.
When the education system‘s curriculum is reviewed next, climate change education will be made a priority and educational grants will be allocated by the Ministry of Education and Children to climate education projects. Education on climate change will be increased at all educational levels and provided through various educational channels. The goal is for schools to be able to offer varied and comprehensive education on climate change, its consequences and what we can do to combat it, in line with the sustainability principle which lays at the core of all education. 
A contract has been signed with the NGO Landvernd on creating educational material on climate change and climate issues for schools. The education material is connected to the project Eco-Schools Iceland which has been running in Iceland since 2001 and currently reaches over 200 schools at all education levels.

A part of the Directive is setting technical requirements so that, for example charging stations fulfil coordinated standards. More work on implementing other Directives concerning energy change and climate change is underway at the Ministry. It will, furthermore, be monitored whether laws and regulations need to be altered or updated further to facilitate energy change in Iceland.";The quantified objective of policies 201, 202, 203 and 204 combined is a 51 kt CO2e reduction in emissions in 2030, compared to a baseline scenario in the Climate Action Plan.;;;;;National;This is not applicable to Iceland, see EEA Joint Committee Decision 269/2019.;Yes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is crucial to use seize those opportunities in order for Iceland to reach its climate targets. Creating a defined framework in order for the sector to be able to do its part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is a joint venture between the government and the fishing sector. A working group with representatives from 5 ministries, lead by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs, has been appointed to work towards this goal. This working group will make proposals on how to achieve energy change in the fishing sector by the 1st of December 2020.

The policy as been expanded since the first publication of the climate action plan and in December 2019 the Minister for the Environment and Natural resources signed a regulation on the sulfur content of particular liquid fuels. On the 1st of January 2020 a similar requirement as is in place in so-called ECA-areas in the Baltic and North seas, where the restrictions on fuel oil are some of the strictest, came into force in the Icelandic coastal zone. After these regulation changes, the permitted sulfur content of marine fuel in Iceland is only 0,1% in the Icelandic coastal zone and internal waters. Previously, the sulfur content was permitted to be up to 3,5%. This effectively prohibits the burning of fuel oil unless ships use approved methods to limit emissions of sulfur dioxide.

Ways to further diminish greenhouse gas emissions from geothermal power plants will be looked into. Although fossil fuels are not used as an energy source in geothermal power plants, they still emit CO2. In 2018, geothermal power plants were the source of 5,3% of Iceland‘s ESD emissions. In the past years these emissions have decreased significantly due to measures by Orka náttúrunnar (ON) at the geothermal plant Hellisheiðarvirkjun. Orkuveita Reykjavíkur (Reykjavík Energy) developed the „CarbFix“ or „gas in rock“ method in collaboration with the University of Iceland and foreign collaborators (see measure 306: Carbon capture from heavy industry) and it has received interest all over the world. ON and Landsvirkjun have shown a great deal of initiative in their plans to reduce emissions from their power plants. As well as reducing emissions through re-injecting CO2 into the basaltic rock HS Orka has been exploring various other solutions and the possibilities to capture CO2 and use it for producing fuel or in other types of industrial production. The companies are working on this measure on their own initiative but the government will follow future developments and consult with them.

The energy change in fish meal factories will be finalized in collaboration with the operators. In the past years fish meal factories have been quite successfully electrified at the operators own initiative. It is important to complete this switch to electricity where it is technologically feasible. A part of the emissions from fish meal factories falls under ETS. Emissions from fish meal factories are volatile in nature, but the overall trend over the last few years is downward. In 1997 ESD emissions from fish meal factories was at its highest, at over 180 kt. It had, however, been reduced to 12  kt in 2019. It must be ensured that this development continues and does not suffer from any setbacks by working on quitting the burning of fossil fuels in fish meal factories completely. One of the measures that will be taken is establishing how electricity security can be increased in the places where fish meal factories are operating, how other technological hindrances such as local loop can be overcome, and how it can be ensured that the price of electricity to fish meal factories is cost-effective compared to oil.

GHG emissions per heavy vehicle (over 3,5 tonnes) are multiple times more than per passenger vehicle and they drive proportionately more. In the year 2018, approximately 15% of road transport emissions were caused by heavy goods transportation. Each additional sustainable vehicle is therefore significant. The main obstacles to energy change in heavy goods transportation are a lack of fuel supply and supply of longer distance vehicles, a lack of infrastructure and consequently a lack of demand for sustainable vehicles. It will be the role of a project management team on energy change to consult with stakeholders and get recommendations on which energy change projects should be the main focus to accelerate the switch to clean energy or sustainable fuels in heavy goods transport. The project management team will continue to work with the proposals made by Græna orkan in February 2020. The project management team will then put forward their suggestions on priority projects, including heavy goods transportation, for the years 2021-2023 by the 1st of December 2020. There are various ways to support progress in heavy goods transportation, such as tax exemptions, support for start-up projects or companies (pilot-projects), research grants, contributions to fuel production, infrastructure or direct equipment purchasing.;Transitioning 15-25% of heavy transport vehicles to clean fuels in 2030 and achieving a corresponding 14 kt CO2e reduction in emissions from heavy transport in 2030, compared to a baseline scenario in the Climate Action Plan.;;;;;National;This is not applicable to Iceland, see EEA Joint Committee Decision 269/2019.;Yes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"; ; ; ";"; ; ; ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

According to an analysis by Íslensk NýOrka, which was conducted during Iceland´s presidency of the Nordic Council of Ministers (Norræna ráðherranefndin) in 2019, most car rental companies have a strong interest in adopting clean energy cars in their operations. There are, however, various obstacles to this development. This measure‘s primary aim is to analyse the main obstacles and opportunities to accelerate energy change in the car fleets of car rental companies through a comprehensive needs- and costs analysis. The measure is connected to measure 201 on concessions for climate friendly vehicles, because with the changes which took effect at the beginning of 2020 to accelerate energy change in road transport, renting out sustainable cars became exempt from VAT turnover. The measure is also connected to measure 202 on infrastructure for climate friendly vehicles, as a special project to install charging stations at accommodations around the country has already begun.;Transitioning 30-50% of rental cars to sustainable fuels in 2030 and achieving a corresponding 28-46 kt CO2e reduction in emissions from rental cars in 2030, compared to a baseline scenario in the Climate Action Plan.;;;;;National;This is not applicable to Iceland, see EEA Joint Committee Decision 269/2019.;Yes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The possibilities for energy change in the patrol ship Þór, from the Icelandic Coast Guards, are already being analysed. The share of sustainable fuels, such as bio diesel will also be increased. Furthermore, a decision has been taken on building a new marine research ship and the tender for its build is currently being prepared. An emphasis was put on saving energy and limiting the environmental impact in the design process. Other energy saving methods in ships will also be used, such as using LED lighting and the cooling water for the diesel engine for heating. It is also assumed that the ship will be equipped with engines which can be powered not only by fossil-fuels, but also by bio fuels and possibly methanol. It will, however, be decided through the development process of a four-speed engine of the size required by the ship, whether it will be possible to equip it with such an engine. Land electricity will furthermore be used at harbor. It is expected that heat exchangers will be set up at the ships home harbor in order for the ship to be able to be heated with water from district heating.

Only emissions from a small part of this, that is the use of heavy machinery, falls under Iceland‘s ESD emissions.  After the first edition of the Climate Action Plan (2018) was published, the Ministry for the Environment, Energy and Climate initiated a lot of research into the climate- and environmental impacts of the construction industry.

The „Carbfix“ or „gas to rock“ method will be explored further, to determine whether it is a realistic option to capture CO2 emissions from heavy industry in Iceland. Reykjavík Energy (Orkuveita Reykjavíkur) has developed the method in collaboration with the University of Iceland and foreign stakeholders and it has received widespread attention around the world. The method involves capturing CO2 from geothermal emissions. The CO2 dissolves in water under pressure and the water is subsequently pumped to a depth of 500-800 meters into the basalt strata, where the CO2 is permanently mineralized. The gas is, in this way, turned into rock. ON, a subsidiary of Reykjavík Energy, has used the method for the last years to reduce emissions from Hellisheiði Geothermal Power Plant with good results. Recently Iceland implemented in the Icelandic law (No 12 from 18 March 2021) an Icelandic adaptation of Directive 2009/31/EC (the CCS Directive) with the aim to enable the EU ETS industry in Iceland to utilize the Carbfix method within the CCS.;This is not a quantifiable measure at this stage.;;;;;National;This is not applicable to Iceland, see EEA Joint Committee Decision 269/2019.;No;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The supply of clean energy vehicles and other more sustainable vehicles has increased rapidly in a short space of time. This policy is based on a principle and how it develops will depend on technological advancement. It is, therefore, expected that there will be some exceptions to the rule, for example due to regional perspectives or for the vehicles of first-responders. The policy also only affects new registrations of diesel- or gas fueled vehicles, it will still be permitted to drive, buy and sell used diesel- or gas fueled vehicles. The ban only applies to the import of new vehicles which are only fueled by fossil fuels. Hereby a significant step is taken in the direction of phasing out fossil fueled vehicles completely. Various other countries, including the UK, France and Norway, have set targets for banning the new registration of fossil fueled vehicles at a certain time.The signal this policy sends to car manufacturers is very important because plans to produce specific car types is are made in the long term. It is, therefore, important that governments all around the world set targets for when markets for fossil fueled cars will either shrink significantly or close entirely. Grænvangur, a collaboration platform on climate issues and green solutions between businesses and government has launched the project Hreinn, 2 and 3, which focuses on increasing the number of clean energy vehicles at Icelandic companies, many of which operate a large fleet.

The new Herjólfur is a hybrid and it is expected that the ship will sail completely on electricity from the Icelandic coast to the Westman Islands. The first trip running completely on electricity was undertaken on the 1st of January 2020. 2. Sævar, the ferry to Hrísey. The ferry will be renewed as an electric ferry. It is expected that the design process can begin late in 2024. 3. Sæfari, the ferry to Grímsey. When the ferry needs to be renewed alternative energy sources than fossil fuels will be considered. Two ferries are privately owned. 4. The ferry in Mjóifjörður. This is a small ferry which the owner is interested in electrifying. 5. Baldur, the ferry in Breiðarfjörður.

Ports across the country will be further electrified systematically. In 2020 grants for infrastructure projects regarding electrical connection and connection to district heating whilst ships are at harbor, in order to reduce reliance on fossil fuels while ships are at harbor. This will be useful for medium sized ships, large trawlers, ferries and service boats. Tourism companies will also have the opportunity to apply for grants as there are many possibilities for electrification that sector. Whale watching boats and other smaller boats which sail shorter distances with tourists, to and from the same port, could for example possibly be electrified. Unlike the larger fishing ships, tourism boats which do many trips a day, would need access to fast charging stations, which are currently not very common. It has been proposed that projects regarding alterations to the ships and land based infrastructure will also have the possibility to apply for grants. The grants will be up to 33% of the start-up costs.

In the WEM scenario, the number of ships were projected using the same GDP proxy, but the emissions at harbour were reduced linearly, for general ship operations, from the start of the policy to 2025. This reflects the goal of the PaM to meet electricity demands of all general ship operations in harbours by 2025. Moreover, general ships are defined as all ships except cruise ships and cargo ships as there are no high-voltage (>1000V) connection in Icelandic harbours. However, PaM 102 is expected to have significant effect on higher utilisation rates of existing infrastructure i.e., 400V connections, which are present. Therefore, cruise ships and cargo ships are expected, in both the WEM scenario and the BaU scenario to utilise oil in harbours, while all other ships are expected to phase out fuel use in harbours linearly, ending at full electricity utilisation in 2025.;Infrastructure development;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The tax is based on the polluter pays principle which stipulates that those who are responsible for pollution pay for the consequences of it. A similar approach is used in Iceland as has been used in Denmark, where a certain price is added per kilogram of F-gases for every tonne CO2e that it emits, up to a price ceiling of 10.000 ISK per kilogram.

Certain other provisions are made in the regulation which aim to further reduce F-gas emissions, such as limits on their marketing and use. Refilling big systems with F-gases which have a very high global warming potential (maximum 2500 GWP) will be banned.

It is the first plant of its kind in Iceland, and it will process municipal solid waste from households from the entire capital area, which contains around two thirds of Iceland’s population. It is planned to process 30 kt of organic waste every year (max capacity: 40 kt) and produce 10 to 12 kt of compost and 3 million Nm3 of CH4 each year. The plant was unable to operate fully in 2021 and, consequently, the expected step wise increase in its operational scale was delayed slightly. The plant is expected to operate at 75% capacity from 2023 onwards, turning 30 kt of waste into compost and methane gas annually.;25.000 tonnes of organic waste/ year (max capacity: 35.000 tonnes) and produce 12.000 tonnes of compost and 3 million Nm3 of CH4 each year.;;;;;Regional;This is not applicable to Iceland, see EEA Joint Committee Decision 269/2019.;No;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;REPORT ON POLICIES, MEASURES AND PROJECTIONS Projections of Greenhouse Gas emissions in Iceland to 2040, 2021 edition;;;;;;;The emission reduction are estimated together with measure 501. While emissions from landfill (CRF code 5A) decrease, emission from biological treatment of waste (CRF 5B) increase and both measures together give the above mentioned emission reduction. The projections in the waste sector, for the subcategories 5A, 5B and 5C are based on the same principle of a mass balance of yearly produced waste, projected in correlation with population numbers. This projected yearly waste amount was consequently allocated to the three subcategories, taking into account the existing policies and operation permits of waste handling companies. Here are no numbers reported, as this measure results in an increase in emissions (but overall decrease from the waste sector together with 501).;Amount of waste sent to landfill, amount of waste sent to gas and composting plant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

An emphasis will be placed on increasing farmers’ knowledge and access to information on how best to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (CH4 and N2O) from agriculture. An important aspect of this effort is to enforce the regulation on protection against water pollution due to nitrogen compounds (NOx) from agriculture and other operations (Icelandic regulation No. 796/1999). The policy scope includes the fertilizer use of all farmers, but it will begin with cattle- and sheep farmers since measures in those fields have already begun (see policies 401 and 402). Through those measures farmers will, among other things, be provided with advice that aims to improve the use of manure, and it will be researched systematically how farmers use their manure. Knowledge and experience from this work will highlight the possibilities that exist to reduce GHG emissions with improved fertilizer use and lay a foundation for increased training and information sharing to other farming sectors. Consequently, it will be the project management group on climate action in agriculture’s role to implement the policy for all farmers.;Use of N-fertilizer, -10% in 2030 compared to a BAU scenario.;;;;;National;This is not applicable to Iceland, see EEA Joint Committee Decision 269/2019.;Yes;;4;;;;6;;;;7;;;;9;;;REPORT ON POLICIES, MEASURES AND PROJECTIONS Projections of Greenhouse Gas emissions in Iceland to 2040, 2022 edition;;;;;;;For the BAU scenario, the amount of N-fertiliser used in Iceland as reported in the NIR (1990-2019) was used to predict its usage until 2040. For the WEM scenario, a 10% reduction of fertilizer use in 2035 from the BAU value is expected. From 2030 to 2040 another linear decrease is projected, as this action is also an education/ training programme and it is expected that it will be rolled out gradually and reach more and more farmers with time.;N-inorganic fertilizer amount imported;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
