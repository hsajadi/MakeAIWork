```sh
git clone git@github.com:{your_github_username}/MakeAIWork.git
```

</li>

<li>

**Configure git**

In order to commit and push your changes, you need identitify yourself.

Open a (git)bash, enter directory MakeAIWork and run:
```bash

```
This script will also set the [pull policy](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-pull) to rebase.

</li>

<li>

**Add upstream to original remote repository**

To be able To be able to fetch and merge changes from this repository using (bash) commands, you need to have a (second) upstream.  
If you used the GitHub client to create the fork you can <strong>skip</strong> this step, otherwise enter the following commands

```bash
git remote add mitwrdam https://github.com/MitwRdam/MakeAIWork
```

</li>

<li>

Keep your fork repository up-todate by regularly pulling changes from the original remote repository into your local fork..
