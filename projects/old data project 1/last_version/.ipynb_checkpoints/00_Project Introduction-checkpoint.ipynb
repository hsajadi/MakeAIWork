To give the patient insight into a change of lifestyle, the doctor can adjust the style, for example adjusting the number of cigarettes per day. The patient is then shown how much influence this has on life expectancy. In addition, the patient is shown what the \"predicted\" influence will be on the insurance premium. After a session, the doctor can use the escape key to return to the starting point."
